# WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations

># Project Pipeline
1. [QC protocol](https://github.com/sudhaveturi/WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations/blob/master/QC%20protocol.md) for MESA and [ARIC] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000398.v3.p1)
2. Perform QC and get final set of genotypes and phenotypes 
3. Finalize [simulation protocol](https://github.com/sudhaveturi/WGR-with-Data-from-Heterogeneous-Populations/blob/master/SimulationProtocol_MESA.md.pdf) and run simulations
3. Perform all analyses with GWAS-significant SNPs only with varying -logP-value cutoffs for three phenotypes that have varying heritabilities: Height, HDL and LDL
4. Perform analyses with the fully available marker dataset and compare race-specific heritability estimates and marker-effect correlations
